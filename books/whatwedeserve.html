                <p>I’m used to being alone, until she changed everything...</p>
                <p>When my ex-wife left, she said the cruelest words she could think of, and I took them all to heart.</p>
                <p>Now I work at my loveable bastard cousin’s tattoo parlor and keep most people at arm’s length. I have the occasional one night stand to take the edge off, but there can never be anything more than that for me.</p>
                <p>I don’t let myself think about how lonely I am. At least I’m not ruining anyone’s life, right?</p>
                <p>Then Emily walks into Wishbone Tattoos, asking about the receptionist job. And this shy, smiling, kindhearted woman is everything I’ve ever wanted.</p>
                <p>I can’t help falling for her, even though I know I mustn't, for both our sakes.</p>
                <p>But there’s something about Emily I don’t know. Something that will make her the exception to my hard and fast rule...</p>
                <p>She’s battle scarred herself, and running scared from a dark past which snaps at her heels, but I’m not going to let anyone hurt her ever again, I swear to god.</p>
                <p>And maybe, if we’re lucky and we both want it hard enough, the two of us will finally get what we deserve.</p>

                    <p>This book deals with themes of relationship emotional abuse experienced by the main characters in previous relationships, and the lasting scars this can leave.</p>
                    <p>There is also content regarding fertility, conception, and childfree life.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, there is mention of a school shooting in America and severe post-traumatic stress disorder, but this is not a main plot point for this novel.</p>
